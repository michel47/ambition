<p>Indeed, this page is accessible via <a href=http://ipfs.io>IPFS</a>,
as we want to promote a true paradigm shift with fast efficient
knowledge infrastructure, we are "remaking" the internet as it was supposed to be before being hi-jacked by
the big corporations (<a href=http://duckduckgo.com/?q=GAFA+%23IPHS>GAFA</a>...)
we are removing the "middle" man in our exchanges simple to avoid abusing
rent extraction which is sucking the life out of most of us. Freeing the internet means re-establishing 
peer-to-peer communication, distributed services among us.

What does it means : it means have each one of us participating the running of the internet,
supporting the infrastructure ourselves means more efficient management of the resources
and operation at cost which is the best model for the emerging sharing economy.

Contributing your piece of the puzzle is simple it means simply running an
<a href=http://duckduckgo.com/?q=installing+running+IPFS+daemon>IPFS node</a>, and pinning
what you like, this allow information you enjoy to be shared and store close to you.


<h2>Jump In the new "Multiplicative Economy"</h2>

Transcapitalism is here, today, where ideas and knowledge is more valuable than oil !

We say No to knowledge Censorship, and yes to Peer to Peer free topologies.

<h3>Participatory Network</h3>

<p> We go a great length to build the next internet away from the big corporations,
We go distributed rather than centralized, we operate on eco friendly devices.
and we don't need heavy machine running in huge data center.

In fact are at the edge of the internet so we don't need to have data moved around a lot.
most of the time it is local, on your very own machine.

We are building a human network with a communication structure to enable the knowledge economy.
